    "# Single-subject Modelling in SPM\n",
    "In the final section of this lesson, we will see how to specify a single-subject GLM using `SPM12`. These models are also known as *1st-level* models, for reasons we will cover later in the module. The example data for this section consists of a fully pre-processed [functional scan](https://livemanchesterac.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/UOM-FBMH-MSc-NCCN/Shared%20Documents/PCHN62121%20Image%20Analysis/Learning%20Materials/Asynchronous/Week%2008/2.%20Single-subject%20Models/Data/swRD018_PP012_Encoding.nii?csf=1&web=0&e=Xa6YSE&download=1) with associated [timing information](https://livemanchesterac.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/UOM-FBMH-MSc-NCCN/Shared%20Documents/PCHN62121%20Image%20Analysis/Learning%20Materials/Asynchronous/Week%2008/2.%20Single-subject%20Models/Data/Timings.xlsx?d=w643a1e9e9efc44768b132bed48c4b00d&csf=1&web=0&e=tFu9G8&download=1).\n",

    "## Example Experiment\n",
    "The example experiment is a simple block design that involved viewing pictures of different valences. Each block consisted of 6 pictures from the same valence category and the blocks were arranged as illustrated in {numref}`ex-design-fig`.\n",

    "Between each repetition of *positive*, *negative* and *neutral* blocks, the subjects were asked to rest for 15 seconds. During this time, they saw a fixation cross on the screen. This turned into a double-cross 5 seconds before the end of the rest period, as illustrated in {numref}`fix-ex-fig`.\n",

    "In terms of the scanning details, the TR was 2s, the TE was 30ms and the voxel size was 3mm isotropic. 145 volumes were collected of dimensions $53 \\times 63 \\times 52$. The data has already been preprocessed by realignment to the first volume, normalisation to MNI space and Gaussian smoothing using a kernel of 8mm FWHM.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling Approach\n",
    "In terms of the modelling approach, a simple on-off dummy variable can be specified for each valence condition. These variables can then be convolved with the canonical HRF. Importantly, we will choose to include the rest periods as an *implicit baseline*. This means we will not model rest explicitly. Instead, rest will form the *constant* or *baseline* condition. As explained earlier, this means the parameter estimates will be interpreted as *mean differences*, representing the average signal change from rest for each experimental condition.\n",
