    "# The General Linear Model\n",
    "To begin with, we will take a high-level perspective on the GLM as a *framework* that can be applied to any dataset. This may appear somewhat abstract on a first read, however, we will see how this is applied to a real dataset in the next section. At this point, we are not talking about fMRI data specifically. Given that this is a specialised application of the GLM, we first need to discuss the general theory before seeing how it can be applied to neuroimaging data.\n",

    "## The General Linear Model Framework\n",
    "To begin with, we will discuss the mathematical framework behind the GLM. In order to understand the GLM, we need to understand *multiple regression* which, in its most basic form, is know as *simple* regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple Regression\n",
    "In a simple regression model there is a single outcome variable $y$ that is associated with a single predictor variable $x$. The simple regression model takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{i} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{i} + \\epsilon_{i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which defines a straight-line fit to the data, where $\\beta_{0}$ representing the *intercept* and $\\beta_{1}$ representing the *slope*. The term $\\epsilon$ quantifies the amount of *error* in the model, allowing for the fact that a perfect fit between the two variables is rarely possible. This model is illustrated in {numref}`simple-fig`. In this example, the manager of a building company wants a good estimate of the required number of hours to build given the size of the lot. \n",

    "Illustration of how a simple regression model amounts to constructing a straight-line to summarise the relationship between the predictor variable and the outcome variable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the simple regression model consists of a straight line through the scatterplot of measurements. For each value of `Lot Size`, the point on the regression line represents the predicted value of `Hours`. The magnitude of the estimated slope is therefore of interest, given that this quantifies the *strength* of the relationship between the two variables. However, we also need to consider how close the raw data sits to the regression line, as data that are tightly-packed around the regression line suggest a model that fits the data well. This concept of *model fit* is therefore quantified by the *errors*. The smaller that the $\\epsilon$ terms are, the shorter the vertical distances between the regression line and the raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts can be further understood by considering the probability model for a simple regression\n",

    "$$\n",
    "y_{i} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}x_{i}, \\sigma)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the example from {numref}`simple-fig`, each value of `Lot Size` is therefore associated with a normal distribution of values for `Hours` where the means sit along the population regression line. An illustration of this concept is given in {numref}`simple-prob-fig`.\n",

    "\n",
    "The standard deviation of these normal distributions is given by $\\sigma$ and reflects how widely spread the data are around the regression line. There is therefore a direct connection between the width of the assumed probability distributions and the model errors. Remembering that this probability model represents the *population*, the aim of a simple regression analysis is to use a *sample* to estimate both the *mean* and *variance* of the population distribution. As the mean depends upon the parameters $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$, these must also be estimated from the sample. Finding the line that best fits the data will result in estimates for $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$. The errors resulting from this fit can then be used to estimate $\\sigma$ and the probability model is complete. \n",

If significant, we would assume some non-zero relationship is present in the population and can interpret what the magnitude of the slope tells us about the relationship under study. In the context of the simple regression model, the aim is usually to *predict* the outcome using the values of the predictor. For the example above, this would result in the manager of the building company being able to predict `Hours` by only knowing the value of `Lot Size`. This would allow the manager to determine if more or fewer workers need to be hired as production demands are scaled up or down.\n",

    "Conceptually, much of multiple regression is the same as simple regression, except for a few details. Firstly, rather than a regression line this model estimates a regression *plane* in $k$-dimensional space. For instance, if $k=2$ then the model can be visualised as shown in {numref}`plane-fig`\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The means of the assumed normal distributions are no longer points along a regression line, rather they become points on a plane in $k$-dimensional space. The individual regression slopes for each predictor $\\left(\\beta_{j}\\right)$ are given by the *edges* of this plane (where $j = 1,\\dots,k$). Importantly, these slopes are not the same as fitting a simple regression model to each predictor separately. The slope coefficients represent the effect of each predictor after taking all other predictors into account. This means that adding or altering the predictors will change *all* the parameter estimates. This is an important point because many statistical modelling decisions are built upon this fact. For instance, the notion of *controlling* for the effect of a variable is based directly upon this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these differences, the multiple regression model proceeds in much the same fashion as simple regression. The individual parameters of the mean function can be estimated to produce a single estimate for the intercept $\\left(\\beta_{0}\\right)$ and $k$ estimates for the slopes $\\left(\\beta_{1},\\dots,\\beta_{k}\\right)$. Estimation of the variance again proceeds using the errors, which now represent vertical distances from the regression *plane* to the raw data. Hypothesis tests can then be performed on each of the estimates to determine which of the $k$ variables appears to show a significant non-zero relationship with the outcome. This involves testing null hypotheses of the form\n",

    "Much like simple regression, the general aim is the accurate *prediction* of the outcome, this time using value of *multiple* variables. For instance, the manager of the building company may enhance their model of `Hours` by also considering `Wage` and `Age` of the workers, alongside `Lot Size`. This may allow for a more accurate prediction of `Hours`, as well as allowing the manager to determine which factor is the most influential and where the focus should be when considering how to adapt to changes in production. \n",

The *general* bit of the GLM is a reference to the fact that including continuous predictors in the design matrix will produce a regression model, whereas including categorical predictors will produce an ANOVA model. As we will come to see, the design matrix is such a key part of the GLM that SPM chooses to *visualise* this element as a means of communicating the form of GLM being used to model the fMRI data. As such, understanding how the design matrix is structured is vital to understanding the GLM.\n",

These types of variables enter the design matrix verbatim as column vectors. As such, they do not require any form of special treatment, as we will see in the worked example later in the lesson.\n",

    "### Categorical Predictor Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Any variable that represents a form of *grouping* or *category* is classified as a *categorical* variable. For instance, categories such as diagnostic group, blood type or ethnicity are examples of categorical predictor variables. Compared with continuous variables, categorical variables are more complex to use with the GLM. Fundamentally, the category labels must be converted into numbers. The way this is done is by forming what are known as *dummy variables*. These are variables that conatin either a value of 1 or 0 depending on the category. For instance, if the categories were *patient* or *control*, the dummy variable values could be assigned like so\n",

A unit increase on a dummy variable is equivalent to changing the category from 0 to 1. This means that the regression slope is still interpreted in the same fashion as before, but in this context tells us the *mean difference* between the categories. The *intercept* of this model is therefore the mean of the group coded as 0, the slope is the mean difference and the sum of the intercept and slope gives the mean of the group coded as 1. \n",

In the context of a mean difference, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference in the average value of the outcome variable between the groups (i.e. the means are *identical*). Decisions about whether the null hypothesis can be rejected can be taken by calculating the *p*-value associated with the calculated *t*-statistic via reference to the appropriate null distribution.
